# Guess a Random Number

## Task
*Create a simple number guessing game:*
1. *The random number must consist of 4 different digits.*
2. *The first digit mustn't be zero.*

*Each time the player enters a four-digit number trying to guess the given number. The value "sheep" in the answer means that one of the digits is in the given number, but isn't in the position we need (1-2-3-4). The value "ram" means that the digit is in the given number and it takes its place. The game continues until the player guesses the number completely (4 rams).*

*Additional functionality:*
- *Use LocalStorage to save data: winner's nickname, a number of steps to win, the table of winners.*
